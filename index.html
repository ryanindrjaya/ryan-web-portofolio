          <h2>Who am i?</h2>
          <p>
            I am an Informatics Engineering student at Sebelas Maret University
            who now lives in Jombang. have knowledge and skills in the field of
            Web Development, I mastered HTML, CSS, Javascript, React JS, PHP,
            and database management (mySQL, phpMyAdmin). I have built and
            developed dynamic-responsive websites using Bootstrap 5 technology,
            database integration with PHP and MySQL, and website functionality
            using vanilla Javascript.

          <h2>Focused field?</h2>
          <p>
            Now I focus on front-end development. I often use React.js because
            it uses a lot of pure javascript code which makes it very easy for
            team development. And I also often use the MERN stack to build
            full-stack web applications. I've produced a few front-end projects
            that you can check out on my
            <a href="https://github.com/ryanindrjaya">github</a>, or in the
            projects section below.

            level certifications. Such as Dicoding, Google Developer
            Certification, and several courses on Udemy with rigorous
            evaluation. You can see some of my certifications at the link below.
